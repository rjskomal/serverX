Hi,
If you are an experienced SDE or is someone who is cracked reading this, don't. This is just a project-based-learning.

This is for me to learn stuff, implement and earn. (Damn inflation)
Whatever, I just learnt sockets, implemented a basic server with auth and planning to scale it to learn more.
Altough I don't really enjoy hacking away all the time, I definitely have to do this to survive eventually.

IDGAF about the UI or FE, I just prompted the shit out of co-pilot to give me a template react code that I could use.
The socket code is mine tho.


Nevertheless, I plan to scale this, learn how to deploy, integrate CI/CD, use caching, implement new features, add authorization, containerize this and actually have a good resume.
If you are a beginner and plan to become a software engineer... please don't... go into a creative field like cooking so that you are not replaced XD.

I hope I stay consistent :)
